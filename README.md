# PyTorch Text Classifier

A minimal text classification project built with PyTorch.

## Goal
- Understand the full training loop in PyTorch
- Build a text classifier from scratch (no Hugging Face Trainer)

## What this project includes
- Custom Dataset
- nn.Module model
- Training loop (forward, loss, backward, optimizer step)

## Status
Work in progress.
